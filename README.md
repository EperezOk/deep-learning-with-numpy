# Deep Learning With Numpy

Implementation of Deep Learning models from scratch, using only `numpy` as a dependency.

> `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are also used for plotting.

The following models are to be implemented:

- [x] [Perceptron](src/models/perceptron.py).
- [x] [Multi-Layer Perceptron](src/models/mlp.py).
- [ ] Autoencoder.
- [ ] Variational Autoencoder.
